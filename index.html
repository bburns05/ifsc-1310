    <h3>Feedback Assignment</h3>
    <h4>
      First of all I'd like to thank you Mr. Wallace for all your help and being such an attentive teacher this semester. I really enjoyed this course and this is brand new to me and you made it very simple to understand and helped us the whole way which is very much appreciated. I have come very far in this course and it's hard to wrap my mind around how fast we did it. Firstly, one thing I would have done differently is I should have studied how to target items in css a little better. At times I really struggled with this and it definitely would have saved me some time. I think I did best at just understanding the html very easily. Once you explained it the first couple of weeks I really was able to grasp it well. For the final draft revision I changed up some of the layouts to look better and flow nicer. I also changed up the background and added some javascript. I can't wait for what lies ahead in my new adventure.
